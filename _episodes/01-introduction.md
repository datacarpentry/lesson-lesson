   Manager icon to one of the empty menu squares on the right, Exit Customize**

# Motivation

To start, let's orient ourselves in our project workflow.  Previously, 
we used Excel and OpenRefine to go from from messy, human created data 
to cleaned, computer-readable data.  Now we're going to move to the next piece 
of the data workflow, using the computer to read in our data, and then 
use it for analysis and visualization.  

## Dataset Description

The data we will be using is a time-series for a small mammal community in
southern Arizona. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and
ants on the plant community that has been running for almost 40 years.  The
rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental
manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.

This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We've
simplified it just a little bit for the workshop, but you can download the
[full dataset](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and work with it using
exactly the same tools we'll learn about today.
